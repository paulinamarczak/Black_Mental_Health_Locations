The Employment Equity Act defines visible minorities as "persons  other than Aboriginal peoples  who are non-Caucasian in race or non-white in colour." The visible minority population consists mainly of the following groups: South Asian  Chinese  Black  Filipino  Latin American  Arab  Southeast Asian  West Asian  Korean and Japanese.
